# :heavy_dollar_sign: Ecom README

## Quick Start

+ install yesod with `cabal install yesod-platform yesod-bin`
+ clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:MaxDaten/ecom.git ecom`
+ `cd ecom`
+ `cabal install --onyl-dependencies`
+ `yesod devel`
+ visit http://localhost:3000

## Intro

this file is written in Markdown, a human readable markup language. See more here: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet)

this project is generated by the command `yesod init` and adopted by me (MaxDaten)

yesod is our framework of choiceand I recommend acid-state for the data-holding. so some basics about yesod first of all:


## Basic Setup

### Haskell Setup

+ you have install yesod with cabal, so you will have to install the haskell platform [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) or just ghc and compile cabal on your own (call the ghostbusters (for example me) if you want this way) - remmeber to add `.cabal/bin` to your Path env
+ with a working haskell platform installation:
    + `cabal install yesod-platform yesod-bin`
        + yesod-platform contains all the important core libs
        + yesod-bin is just the executable to generate new projects and start the development server

### GIT

We will use `GIT` for the revision control. There are some differences to `svn`. A good page to start with: [Git Scm Book](http://git-scm.com/book)


### Development

+ to start up just run `yesod devel` in the project root
    + this will (hopefully) run an development server on `http:\\localhost:3000` just browse to it an see further stuff [see FAQ 2.]
    + you can change the most of all source (`.hs`) and template files and the devel server will recompile this for you, you just have to reload your page, to see the result (i tend to implement an .js auto-reload script)


## Project Structure

mostly folderwise explanations:

* `/` (aka root): this is the folder this file lives within
* `ecom.cabal` : haskell project definition (mostly generated by yesod)
* `.ghci` : language pragams for a ghci session
* `.gitignore` : all mateched files will be ignored by git [.gitignore](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html)
* `devel.hs` : yesod generated (just sligtly modified by MaxDaten)
* `src` : added by me for the really important source files (it's a way better than dangling files in root (see a yesod init project)
    * `Main` : Just a hook for yesod (mostly to ignore)
    * `Ecom`
        * `Application` : just app creation and settings reading
        * `Foundations` : binding important yesod functions for operation
        * `Import` : general import files
        * `Model` : here we will place (or rebind) our base data structures for acid-state and/or aeson for json parsing
        * `Settings` : settings handling
            * `Development` : ignore this
            * `StaticFiles` : handling for static web files (images, not code generated css and so on)
        * `Handler`
            * `*` here we will place all our web route definitions (RESTful style) with GET, POST and so on
* `static` : static files like images and css libs, we shouldn't care to much about it
* `template` : awesome shakespeare templates to generate annoying html, js, css files with
* `test` : just testing, i guess we will ignore this mostly ;)
* `messages` : just language translation support (wayne for us too)
* `yesod-devel`, `dist`, `deploy` : just ignore this
* `config` : configuration files (see modules description for `Settings` for differences to config files)
    * `facicon.ico` : if we want fancy, feel free to add a custom ico file
    * `keter.yaml` : just deployment package description
    * `robots.txt` : just google it^^
    * `routes` : here you have to configure new url-routes for our web-app
    * `settings.yml` : base settings for the web app



## FAQ

1. conflicts with `cabal install yesod-platform`
    1. call me (its resolvable but a bit tricky, we should solve this more directly)
2. I can't reach the development server or I see a ugly page (css files are missing)
    2. if you run the devel server not on your localhost, change the `config/settings.yml` settings to the LAN host (for me ex: `approot: "http://192.168.178.200:3000"`)
3. How do I add routes?
    3. create a Handler in `src/Ecom.Handler`, import this Handler into the `Ecom.Application` module, add route definition in `config/routes`
